### How to run

The easiest way is to: 
- open a terminal, cd into the MockAcquiringBank.API directory and run `dotnet watch run`
- open another terminal shell, cd into the `PaymentGateway.API` directory and run `dotnet watch run`
- A browser window should open to the swagger index page. if it doesnt, append `index.html` to the url
- Pass in the required parameters and test the api
